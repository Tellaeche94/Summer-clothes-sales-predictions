# Summer-clothes-sales-predictions

The objective of this project was to create a model that could predict the units sold of a variety of summer clothes based on the characteristics of each product. Additionally, I wanted a tool to observe the possible effects on the sales if, for example, the price increased or decreased.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmmvutu/summer-products-and-sales-in-ecommerce-wish) and the code was written in Python.

I imported the scikit-learn library to create a stacked model, using KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression as base learners. Finally, I used Random Forest as the meta learner.
